								<h2>Dataset</h2>

								<p class="jtext">
									Full presentation of the dataset structure, including statistical tables, with
									instructions on accessing and interpreting the data.
								</p>

								<h3>Overview</h3>

								<p>
									The dataset is hosted on
									<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14029378" target="_blank">Zenodo</a> and has
									been divided into four main components:
								</p>

								<ol>
									<li>Ranging Measurements at Responder Sides (<code>Rangings at Responders.pkl</code>)</li>
									<li>Ranging Measurements at Poller Sides (<code>Rangings at Pollers.pkl</code>)</li>
									<li>Responder Statistics (<code>Rangings at Responders (Stats).pkl</code>)</li>
									<li>Poller Statistics (<code>Rangings at Pollers (Stats).pkl</code>)</li>
								</ol>

								<p class="jtext">
									The <code>Rangings at Responders.pkl</code> and <code>Rangings at Pollers.pkl</code>
									datasets contain Time-of-Flight measurements based on the implemented 4-message TWR
									protocol (see <code>Ranging Protocol</code> section in
									<a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>), captured from both responder
									and poller perspectives. The responder dataset contains measurements calculated at
									the responders' sides after the third message is received, while the poller dataset
									only includes measurements where this enhanced estimate was successfully delivered
									back to the poller via the fourth message. As a result,
									<code>Rangings at Pollers.pkl</code> is effectively a subset of
									<code>Rangings at Responders.pkl</code>, excluding cases where the fourth message
									failed to reach the poller due to collisions or other transmission issues. This
									difference in measurement counts not only provides insight into the reliability
									of message delivery, but also enables simulations requiring end-to-end enhanced
									ranging.
								</p>

								<p class="jtext">
									The <code>Rangings at Responders (Stats).pkl</code> and
									<code>Rangings at Pollers (Stats).pkl</code> provide detailed performance metrics
									captured at one-second intervals during the measurement campaign. The responder
									statistics track each node's performance when operating in responder mode, recording
									the number of successful responses, total response attempts, and message failures at
									different stages of the TWR protocol. Similarly, the poller statistics document each
									node's polling performance, including successful polls, total polling attempts, and
									message failures. Notably, the nodes operate in a fully unsynchronized manner,
									continuously attempting rangings without any time-division coordination or channel
									access scheduling. While this approach results in numerous failed attempts due to
									collisions, it represents a crucial real-world scenario where time synchronization
									infrastructure is unavailable or impractical. With approximately 330,000 statistical
									records per table spanning all 12 scans, these datasets enable detailed analysis of
									protocol resilience and network performance under realistic contention conditions.

								<h4>Poller Measurements (<code>Rangings at Pollers.pkl</code>)</h4>
								<p class="jtext">
									Contains ~1.9M measurements recorded by nodes operating in poller mode. Each
									measurement represents a complete TWR exchange where the enhanced ranging estimate
									was successfully received via the fourth message. The table structure is identical
									to the responder measurements but from the poller's perspective, with matching
									column names and data types.

								<div class="note">
									<h4>Relationship Between Tables</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The responder measurements (~2.1M entries) form a superset of the poller measurements (~1.9M entries)</li>
										<li>The difference in entries (~300K) represents TWR exchanges where the enhanced estimate was calculated at the responder but the fourth message failed to reach the poller</li>
										<li>Each successful poller measurement has a corresponding responder measurement with matching timestamp and swapped node IDs</li>
										<li>All measurements were collected under unsynchronized operation, with nodes continuously attempting ranges without coordinated scheduling</li>

polling_measurements_df = pd.read_pickle("Rangings at Pollers.pkl")

# Load statistics
responder_stats_df = pd.read_pickle("Rangings at Responders (Stats).pkl")
poller_stats_df = pd.read_pickle("Rangings at Pollers (Stats).pkl")

# Display first few rows of ranging measurements
print(responding_measurements_df.head())</code></pre>

								<h3>Data Filtering Example</h3>
								<p>To filter measurements from the evaluation scan (Scan_ID 12):</p>
